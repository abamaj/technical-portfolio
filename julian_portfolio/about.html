                Intro:
            </h1>
            My name is Julian Abam, and I am from Aurora, CO. I'm currently a student at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
            I will be entering my fourth year as a senior student, graduating in May of 2022. I'm so hype to almost be done with my four years of labor.

                Passions & Goals:
            </h1>
            In school, I am studying Computer Science and Minoring in Data Science and Creative Technology and Design. My interests include machine learning engineering, artificial intelligence, and UI/UX design. I enjoy tapping into my
            creativity, and seek to find a way to draw a bridge between that, my interest in computational tools, and my love for sports to create soemthing 
            that can hopefully contribute to helping people with their fitness needs.

                Fun Fact:
            </h1>
            When I was 9 years old, I ran into a glass door thinking it was open space. I left the experience with half a front 
            right tooth.
